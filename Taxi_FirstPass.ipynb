    "The private hire travel industry is estimated to be worth $100 billion dollars worldwide and there are an estimated 15million taxi drivers worldwide. As cities grow denser and travel infrastructures strain, the demand for private hire vehicles (as opposed to personal ownership) has increased. This is evident with the sharp rise of companies like Uber and Lyft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, there is the growing issue of climate change brought on by pollution; one of the key culprits being vehicle emissions. The increase usage of private hire vehicles has actually helped with this somewhat as it is much more efficient to have fewer, specialised vehicles to transport people rather than have everyone own a car. However, more can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful taxi driver is one that can minimise the downtime between picking up and travelling to their passengers but this also has the added benefit of minimising vehicle emissions by reducing wasted travelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "With data gathered from taxis over the past few years, it may be possible to build a model that can predict when and where clients will be before they have even requested a taxi. If this is done effectively, taxi drivers will be able to minimise downtime between clients and thus, increase profits and decrease vehicle emissions.\n"

    "Taxi drivers can be broadly split into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Freelance drivers who look for clients to hail them\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Drivers who are on call and respond to requests from a dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Drivers who pick up passengers from a specific location (E.g. airports, train stations)\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will mostly benefit the first two categories as the first group solely relies on being in the right place at the right time, while the second group could minimise their downtime by being close to a potential client before being dispatched. Should this predictive model be sucessful, the need for the third category would be redundant as groups 1 and 2 should have it covered."

    "The data files are split into months and represent data from three different taxi types. The first being the famous Yellow taxis, the second being the Green taxis (that arrived in 2013 to cover the much neglected 'north' of New York) and For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) which covers upcoming taxi companies such as Uber and Lyft.\n",
